# Igneous-Rocks-Classification

Is a series of codes to use in iDiscover (QEMSCAN) to classify Igneous Volcanic Rocks. At this date (03 October 2020) I don't get access to the software to confirm that the codes are written correctly.

Every classification is written en different document to view it more easily.
